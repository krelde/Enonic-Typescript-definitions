# Enonic XP Typescript definitions and modules

Enonic XP Typescript definitions with JSdoc comments.

The comments/descriptions are copied from the  [Enonic XP Javascript Libraries](http://repo.enonic.com/public/com/enonic/xp/docs/6.9.4/docs-6.9.4-libdoc.zip!/index.html). 

The defintions for XP are locted in the file xp.d.ts (with "support" interfaces under the "data interface"  folder). The rest of the files are module declarations for the interfaces described in xp.d.ts.
